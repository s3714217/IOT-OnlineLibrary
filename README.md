---------
- This is a library management system project that allows new/current users to perform tasks such as searching for books, 
 borrowing books, and returning books. This process can be done by simply allowing the user to login to the system from
 reception (using either their credintials or face recognition) or register as a new user. After that, the user has an
 access to the system to search, borrow, or even return books. Also, after the user selects a certain book to borrow, an 
 email will be sent to the user to confirm the book has been borrowed. Also, a google event will be created in the user's 
 calendar to remind the user when to return the book. Finally, if the user wants to return the book, the user has to note
 the book id in order to return a certain book. The admin user can access a web application to add books, remove books, and    generate statistics data visualization for books borrowed in a certain timeline. Also, the admin has authority to view/remove current users from the system.
